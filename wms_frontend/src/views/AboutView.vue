      <br>•Technologent takes direct ownership of the focused integration project process. Together with Technologent's highly qualified engineering staff performing the integration tasks, customer systems are assembled, configured and tested using the industry best practices and quality assurance methodologies producing a completed turn-key solution delivered to the customer.
      <br><br>•The Integration Center encompasses a large area of floor space, useable in different configuration order arrangements depending on the system equipment size and volume. Up to eight 72-inch-high cabinets mounted on shipping pallets can be positioned within the center (without removal from the pallets) for power up and integration. Up to twelve dismounted cabinets can also be set up.
      <br><br>•Larger orders can also be staged within the additional space provided at the facility, as the integration process will accommodate groups of systems and systems cabinets as they transitioning and out of the Integration Center.
      <br><br>•Additionally, orders consisting of large groups of "free-standing"dismounted systems can be integrated as well.
      <br><br>•Dedicated troubleshooting and service benches are also available.<br><br>
